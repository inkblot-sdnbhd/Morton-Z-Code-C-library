# Morton-Z-Code-C-library
Morton Z code encoding/decoding/manipulation - c headers 3D, 2D 32 and 64 bit

The Morton order is a mapping from an n-dimensional space onto a linear list of numbers. If you apply it to coordinates, the morton order defines a space-filling curve which is Z-shaped â€“ so it is often is often called Z-order or Z-curve. This idea has inspired a lot of people doing great stuff with graphics (especially ray tracing and collision detection), compression, etc.

The other libraries seem to generally assume that a z-code will be generated each time coordinates are selected. This one uses "tesseral arithmetic" to directly add/subtract values to z-encoded coordinates, which makes it very efficient for defining a space and doing things inside (or outside) it. 

Nearly all of these functions could be made into one-liners with a little code golf; MSVC (by default) and GCC (with -O) will happily inline them. There is a little bit of test code at the end of each file for inspiration. 

A quick summary, from the 2d_32bit library - the others have the same functionality
